# Evaluating GenAI Tools: A Standardized Framework for Institutional Adoption

## Introduction

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) refers to machine learning models capable of producing original content—such as text, images, or code—based on prompts. Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are increasingly being integrated across a wide range of organizational settings—from universities and schools to corporations, nonprofits, and government agencies.

As promising as these tools are, their rapid adoption raises critical questions. What criteria should be used to determine if a GenAI tool is safe, ethical, and effective? Can a tool that works well in one environment be trusted across an entire institution? Should decision-makers prioritize cost, data privacy, explainability, or long-term sustainability?

Without clear and consistent standards, organizations risk adopting tools that compromise privacy, reinforce bias, or misalign with their values and mission. Some may embrace overly permissive systems that lack transparency; others may reject potentially useful tools due to uncertainty. This fragmented approach can lead to inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and reputational risks.

This guide addresses that gap. It proposes a standardized framework for evaluating GenAI tools for institutional use, designed to help organizations assess them responsibly, consistently, and transparently. By following the criteria outlined here, institutions of all kinds can better align tool adoption with their operational goals, ethical principles, and stakeholder needs.
