# Core Evaluation Criteria for Institutional Adoption

## 1. Ethics & Accountability

Ethical AI adoption requires transparency, explainability, and human oversight. Institutions must ensure that GenAI tools are aligned with responsible use policies and that their operations can be understood and challenged when necessary.

**What to Look For:**
- Clear explanations of how outputs are generated
- Ability to trace decisions or content generation (auditability)
- Built-in safeguards against harmful, misleading, or biased outputs
- Ability for humans to override or review system-generated content
- Published documentation or “system cards” detailing limitations and risks

*Example:* OpenAI’s GPT-4 system card includes detailed explanations of how the model was evaluated, its known limitations, and ethical guardrails.

## 2. Data Privacy & Security

GenAI tools often rely on large volumes of input data—some of which may be sensitive. It is essential that tools comply with data protection regulations and institutional privacy standards.

**What to Look For:**
- Compliance with relevant data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, FERPA, HIPAA)
- Clear data retention, deletion, and anonymization policies
- Explicit consent for data collection and use
- Options to restrict or disable data sharing with vendors
- End-to-end encryption and robust access controls

*Example:* An institution working in healthcare must ensure any AI tool handling patient data is HIPAA-compliant and prevents external sharing.

## 3. Fairness & Bias Mitigation

All AI systems have the potential to reflect or amplify social biases. Tools used in education, hiring, or decision-making must be evaluated for fairness across diverse groups.

**What to Look For:**
- Evidence of bias testing across demographic groups
- Inclusive training data or fine-tuning practices
- Tools for flagging or correcting biased outputs
- Transparent disclosure of known biases or blind spots

*Example:* Google’s “Fairness Indicators” toolkit provides a way to analyze how machine learning models perform across different user subgroups.

## 4. Performance & Domain Relevance

GenAI tools should be tested not only for general accuracy, but for how well they perform in the specific domain of use.

**What to Look For:**
- Domain-specific benchmarks or evaluations
- Examples of successful use in similar institutions or sectors
- Consistency of output quality across varied prompts
- Handling of edge cases and complex tasks

*Example:* A GenAI tool used in a law firm should be tested for its ability to handle legal terminology accurately.

## 5. Usability & Accessibility

A GenAI tool’s effectiveness is limited if users cannot easily understand or access it. Institutions should ensure tools are usable by both technical and non-technical users, and meet accessibility standards.

**What to Look For:**
- Intuitive interface and documentation for non-experts
- Keyboard and screen reader support (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance)
- Mobile-friendly or cross-platform access
- Available onboarding materials or in-product tutorials

## 6. Institutional Fit & Integration

A tool that performs well on its own may still fail if it doesn’t integrate with existing systems or support institutional workflows.

**What to Look For:**
- Compatibility with learning or content management systems
- Support for APIs or integrations
- Licensing that fits institutional budgets and policies
- Availability of technical support and long-term maintenance

## 7. Customization & Governance

Institutions may need to adjust GenAI tools to suit local policies or values. The ability to customize outputs, enforce controls, and monitor use is key to sustainable adoption.

**What to Look For:**
- Adjustable model parameters or fine-tuning options
- Access to usage logs, reporting, or dashboards
- Role-based permissions and admin settings
- Governance frameworks that define accountability
