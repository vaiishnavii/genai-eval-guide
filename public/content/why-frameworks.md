# Why Standardized Evaluation Frameworks Are Needed

Generative AI tools are rapidly evolving, and organizations are adopting them at an unprecedented pace. However, without standardized evaluation criteria, institutions often rely on ad hoc, inconsistent methods to assess tools. This creates several problems:

- **Lack of transparency**: Without common standards, it becomes difficult to understand how and why certain tools are adopted over others.
- **Inconsistent decisions**: One department may adopt a GenAI tool that another department deems unsafe or ineffective.
- **Ethical and legal risks**: Without proper vetting, institutions may unknowingly adopt tools that pose privacy, security, or bias-related risks.

Standardized evaluation frameworks offer a solution by providing shared criteria for comparing tools. These frameworks are particularly important when:

- **Tools are being used in sensitive decision-making** contexts (e.g. hiring, admissions, grading).
- **There are multiple stakeholders involved**, each with different priorities.
- **Compliance with regulations or ethical guidelines is necessary.**

Such frameworks can enhance **institutional accountability**, promote **safe and ethical AI use**, and ensure that tools align with an organizationâ€™s values and needs.
