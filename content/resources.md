# Case Studies 

## Stanford’s HELM

The HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) project by Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundation Models is one of the most comprehensive efforts to evaluate GenAI systems. It uses standardized scenarios and multiple dimensions—such as accuracy, robustness, fairness, and efficiency—to compare model performance.

**Why it matters:** HELM doesn’t just focus on performance metrics. It provides a blueprint for transparent, multi-faceted model assessment that aligns with institutional values.

## OpenAI’s System Cards (GPT-4)

OpenAI publishes system cards to document the capabilities, limitations, and safety considerations of its models. The GPT-4 system card includes details about red teaming efforts, known biases, misuse prevention techniques, and risk assessment methods.

**Why it matters:** These documents promote transparency and can help institutions make informed decisions about whether or how to adopt such models.

## IBM’s Approach to AI Red Teaming

IBM outlines an approach to AI red teaming that simulates adversarial attacks to uncover vulnerabilities in GenAI models. This practice identifies potential misuse cases, helps institutions understand risk exposure, and is increasingly part of responsible AI adoption.

**Why it matters:** Institutions need to evaluate not just performance, but resilience to harmful use. Red teaming supports proactive, safety-centered decision-making.

## Google’s Fairness Indicators Toolkit

Originally developed to assess fairness in ML classification systems, Google’s Fairness Indicators offer open-source tools to analyze how models perform across different demographic groups.

**Why it matters:** This resource can be adapted to evaluate how GenAI tools treat users of diverse backgrounds—an essential part of institutional equity goals.
