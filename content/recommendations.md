# Recommendations for Institutions

## 1. Establish a Multi-Stakeholder Review Process

Include voices from multiple departments—IT, legal, ethics, pedagogy (for academic orgs), operations, and end-users. This ensures that decisions are informed by both technical and contextual expertise.

**Note:** Create an internal “AI Oversight Committee” to review proposals and conduct evaluations.

## 2. Use or Customize an Evaluation Framework

Start with the seven core criteria presented in this guide. Adapt the framework to your sector, audience, and risk tolerance. Use checklists or scorecards to document decisions transparently.

**Note:** Turn these criteria into a downloadable rubric to assess vendors consistently.

## 3. Prioritize Transparency from Vendors

Only consider GenAI providers who disclose model documentation, limitations, safety mechanisms, and data practices. Avoid black-box systems that cannot be evaluated or explained.

**Note:** Request system cards, bias audit reports, or red teaming summaries.

## 4. Plan for Ongoing Monitoring and Governance

Evaluation should not stop after implementation. Establish feedback loops, user training, and review cycles to adapt policies as GenAI tools evolve.

**Note:** Track usage metrics and periodically reassess tools.

## 5. Align GenAI Adoption with Your Institution’s Mission

Every organization has different values. Use your mission as a compass for which tools you adopt and how you use them.

**Note:** Ask: “Does this tool help us do what we claim to stand for, responsibly?”
